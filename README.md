<h2> About Sweeper</h2>

Sweeper is a project which I developed for the practice purpose of Java. The game rule is cloned from Microsoft's classic game Minesweeper. Although the rule is quite straightforward for human beings, it's not that easy for developers to implement via programming and computing. That's the reason why I choose it as my Java exercise.
